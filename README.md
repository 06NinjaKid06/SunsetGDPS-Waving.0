## Geometry Dash Private Server
A PHP server, which should react exactly, how RobTop's server could react...

Supported version of Geometry Dash: 1.0 - 2.1 (so any version of Geometry Dash works, as of writing this [11th February 2017])

Required version of PHP: 5.6 (7.0 - untested, 5.3 - confirmed to not be working)
